# MetaFox Issue Tracker

Use this [issue tracker](https://github.com/metafoxapp/metafox-issues/issues) to report any problems you encounter with phpFox.

Please search the bug tracker for your issue before posting, in order to avoid duplicating issues.

When submitting a bug report, please post the following in order for us to consider it and for it not to be rejected for lack of information:

**Do:**

1. Include in the title a short description of the bug you are reporting. (Example: Marketplace Featured Listings - Not Loading).
2. Include in the main text of the issue exactly what one thing is broken. ONE thing. Be very descriptive.
3. If possible, include a screen shot
4. Only put one bug per issue.
5. Include the browser version, os and version, mobile device(if using mobile), phpFox version that you are testing.
6. Try to reproduce on our Demo site at - [https://demo.metafox.app/](https://demo.metafox.app/) since it might be the issue due to 3rd party application on your site

**Don't:**

1. Open an issue with a description with a link to a closed bug. Please put all details
2. Say a one word thing for what the issue is. That's far too vague.
3. Don't put more than one bug per issue. We will close any issues with more than one thing as we can only work on one thing per revision number.
4. Don't post unnecessary comments not related to the issue itself. Issues with any statements derogatory to phpFox will be rejected and closed immediately. 
5. Don't bash staff or harass staff or clients. 
6. Don't post any porn or adult type of images.

*We reserve the right to remove, edit or alter any comments or feature requests or block anyone from posting to our tracker should they voilate these terms.*

**No feature requests in this tracker**

If you have a feature request, please post it [here](https://github.com/PHPfox-Official/phpfox-v4-feature-requests/issues).
